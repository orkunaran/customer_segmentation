**About The Repository** 

This repository included a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis). My intiution in this repo includes follows:

1. Description of total customers with EDA
2. Clustering - K-prototypes algorithm
3. Description of clusters 
4. Suggestions 


I practiced K-prototypes clustering in this repository. I choosed it beacuse of the mixed types of columns in the dataset. And my results were as follows:

* Cluster 3 (gold customers) obviously earn the biggest amount among other clusters yet they are not the highest buyers of some items such as Fruits, Gold products.

* Almost for any product, the highest buyers are Gold or Premium custormers. I think there are 2 ways for this shop; the first one is to keep current gold and premium customers buy their products, and make some exclusive deals for them - For example some deals for high / moderate quality wine and cheese with it. The second one is to attract customers in lower clusters (regular and bronze). I don't know the product range of this shop, maybe all items are more expensive than other shops or the items are high quality items which cost more. Without proper knowledge, it can be suggested that one of both wheter increase the product range (low- medium and high quality) for anyone can purchase; or create deals to attract low-middle incomed customers.


* It is obvious that Cluster 1 follows deals. I suggest, keep track of their purchasing behaviours, and react with deals according to change.

* Bronze, gold and premium customers choose online shopping. Let's create e-mail subscriptions, instagram accounts (if not present) etc to reach potential customers in these clusters. Also, be sure current customers know about deals, discounts etc.

* Premium and gold customers make catalog buying. Catalog buying means buying with e-mail order and requires shipping to the adress. Shipping deals or free shipping would be a good idea. And make sure if the items received in time!.

* Store purchases are similar, the above mentioned suggestions would be good for this also.

* Number of web visits and online shopping give good results: Regular customers visit web page a lot, but they aren't buying stuff. However premium and gold customers visit web page less. I am thinking that these premium and gold customers know what they are buying, won't spend too much time online. Regular customers can be a good online shoppers. They mostly buy wine and meat products.

**The End**

I hope you like my approach, if you do please consider giving a star to my repo.

Best wishes
